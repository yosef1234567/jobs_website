Recidiviz was part of Y-Combinator\u2019s 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Ford Foundation, Mackenzie Scott, Schmidt Futures, Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Mozilla Foundation.</p>\n<p>Today, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) 11 state partners \u2013 big and small, red and blue \u2013 and covers 25% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners \u2013 from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.</p>\n<p>To learn more about how we do what we do, check out our <a href=\"%22http://recidiviz.org/yir22%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">2022 Year in Review</a>, read some <a href=\"%22https://www.recidiviz.org/press%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">press coverage</a>, or watch our recent <a href=\"%22https://www.recidiviz.org/updates/how-bad-data-traps-people-in-the-u-s-justice-system%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">TED Talk</a>.

Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks.

            "description": "<div class='\"content-intro\"'>\n<div class=\"h2\">About Griffin</div>\n<p>Hi, we\u2019re Griffin! We\u2019re the bank for companies who want to build and launch financial products.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\">Our context</div>\n<p>We're rapidly heading towards a future where most of us access financial services through technology companies rather than high street banks. All sorts of companies are now <strong>embedding financial products</strong> into their apps and user journeys so that their customers can seamlessly make payments, manage expenses, take out loans, save, invest, and do more.</p>\n<p>The problem is that companies are still dependent on legacy banking infrastructure if they want to offer regulated financial products. They need to either partner directly with an (slow-moving, risk-averse) incumbent bank and/or stitch together middleware from various Banking as a Service (BaaS) providers. This process is slow, expensive, and complex and makes it very hard for companies to get new financial products off the ground.</p>\n<p>At Griffin, we want to change this.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\">Our purpose</div>\n<p>We want to make it easy for companies to bring finance to their customers at the point of greatest relevance. So, we built a bank.</p>\n<p>But not just any bank! Griffin is a technology platform <em>and</em> a bank: fully regulated, API-first, developer-centric, and purpose-built to serve innovative fintechs and brands who want to build and embed financial products.</p>\n<p><a href=\"%22https:/griffin.com/about%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">Learn more about what we do.</a></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">Our c<strong>ulture</strong></div>\n<p>Our culture is our most important asset, and one of the ways we safeguard it is by being extremely intentional about hiring the right people. We won't hire people who don\u2019t seem like a strong fit for our core values, even if they're otherwise extremely qualified.</p>\n<p>We also believe that smart, motivated, conscientious people thrive in high-trust, high-autonomy environments. That\u2019s why we\u2019re transparent by default, and we encourage open discussion and challenge across all levels of the organisation. We\u2019re also remote-first, asynchronous, and fully flexible - because you're the expert on how and when you do your best work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"%22https:/griffin.com/culture%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">Learn more about our culture.</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class='\"job-preview-styles__description--2BkR3\"'>\n<div class=\"h1\">Software Engineer, Infrastructure &amp; Tooling</div>\n<div class=\"h3\">The Cloud Engineering Team</div>\n<p>Cloud engineering is a small team within the larger engineering group. We\u2019re ultimately responsible for making sure that the systems are in place to test, build, deploy, and run our applications quickly, correctly, and securely.</p>\n<p>Rather than \"move fast and break things\", we aim to move <em>thoughtfully</em> and to make few mistakes. We are an output-driven environment that operates with extreme autonomy; people are free to\u00a0<a href=\"%22https:/www.notion.so/8a2e93bd07834115a0aea325400a05b1?pvs=21%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">keep their own hours</a>\u00a0and we don't micro-manage each other.</p>\n<p>Our infrastructure is all in AWS. The core database is FoundationDB, and applications are built using Bazel and deployed as containers to Kubernetes. We currently use CloudFormation Development Kit (CDK) to define our infrastructure-as-code and deploy our apps, which is done automatically on merge by CircleCI.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\">Who are you?</div>\n<p>An ability for self-directed learning is a must. We don\u2019t expect you to have experience with every product we use, but we do want you to have a grasp of the underlying principles of <em>most</em> and be able to pick up the specifics as you go.</p>\n<p>You should have a good knowledge of software engineering practices, especially with regards to security and testing. You will be writing code for internal tools as well as infrastructure as part of this role, and we want that to meet the same standard as application code written by the product engineering teams.</p>\n<p>The cloud engineering team is often directed by the technical requirements of other parts of the company, so you need to be able to research new products and make sensible suggestions rapidly.</p>\n<p>Deeper knowledge in any of the following areas, allowing you to critically examine some of our existing systems and processes for potential improvements or alternatives soon after joining, is ideal:</p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Infrastructure as code</li>\n<li style=\"\">Core cloud provider services (IAM, VPC, compute, object storage etc)</li>\n<li style=\"\">Kubernetes (managed or otherwise)</li>\n<li style=\"\">Software engineering (Any of Typescript, Python, Go, or Clojure)</li>\n<li style=\"\">Distributed systems</li>\n<li style=\"\">Build tooling</li>\n<li style=\"\">IP networking</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Operational experience with any of the <em>specific</em> products we currently use (AWS, Bazel, CDK, FoundationDB, CircleCI) is a further advantage, but not required.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\">What will you be doing here?</div>\n<p>As an Engineer in the Cloud team, you'll be responsible for building, operating and monitoring our production infrastructure. We are building a bank that will handle thousands of transactions per second. Correctness, performance, and reliability are paramount.</p>\n<p>This is a programming job, with a focus on infrastructure and tooling. You will have the opportunity to specialise in one or both, but in either case you will be writing code for tools used by engineers in other teams, and for administration of the systems and services we deploy.</p>\n<p>The kinds of things you'll work on include:</p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Writing infrastructure as code to configure our AWS accounts and regions in a standard and repeatable way.</li>\n<li style=\"\">Managing our base infrastructure, Kubernetes, and FoundationDB.</li>\n<li style=\"\">Writing internal tools to turn what are currently periodic manual processes into automated ones.</li>\n<li style=\"\">Speeding up our Continuous Deployment pipeline.</li>\n<li style=\"\">Developing our resilience from automated availability zone failure recovery to full regional failover.</li>\n<li style=\"\">Supporting other engineering teams with new infrastructure requests, and building out self-service tooling for them to use in future.</li>\n<li style=\"\">Improving our scalability with deployment and cluster autoscaling based on internal custom metrics.</li>\n<li style=\"\">Writing internal tools to make monitoring, logging, alerting, and debugging easier and faster.</li>\n<li style=\"\">Writing code to verify our systems are correct after power / network etc. failures, a restore from backup, or disaster-recovery failover to secondary regions.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h3\">\u00a0</div>\n</div>\n<div class='\"content-conclusion\"'>\n<div class=\"h2\">What can we offer you?</div>\n<p>We are an early stage startup and we're working hard to expand our benefits package.

About half of the company is based within occasional commuting distance of London, the other half is full-time remote.</em></p>\n<p>Our goal is for Griffin to proportionally represent the diversity of the working population in society.

Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as \u201cSenior\u201d to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. \u201cEngineer, Platform\u201d, \u201cSales, Business Development\u201d or \u201cManager, Talent\u201d).

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply.

To date, tens-of-thousands of subgraphs have been deployed on the hosted service, and now subgraphs can be deployed directly on the network.

It currently operates in 45 cities across multiple countries. It has raised $150 million in Series B funding, five times what it raised in its previous priced round last November with world class investors such as BOND and Y Combinator, which is the precursor of the likes of Airbnb, Stripe, Dropbox, Doordash, among others.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We\u2019re not just about serving people - we\u2019re about creating a marketplace\u00a0to bring people what they need while infusing social values.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">Job Description</div>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Tech organization in Yassir is applying engineering and product \u201cbest practices\u201d - to operate efficiently and build secured, efficient and user-friendly products and services - that can scale and be platformized across different business domains.\u00a0We\u2019ve identified one area that can provide both tech excellence and business impact: authentication of users across our products and offerings.\u00a0\u00a0The desired state of Authentication is one of a central, secure, efficient and scalable, initially for 1st party web and native applications, and later - for untrusted 3rd parties.Central authentication is one of the core competencies of a tech company, which is not measured by ROI or other financial/business matrices. It is measured by product and engineering metrics, such as login conversion rate, # of accounts creation, # of security incidents, etc.\u00a0Central authentication could pave the way for our own digital identity platform and IDP.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Identity</strong><strong> Provider (IDP</strong>)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Identity platform will allow Yassir to be a leading identity provider (IDP) in its region, offering frictionless and secured access to sites, apps and tools, including portability of data and digital assets, such as digital wallet, loyalty wallet, historical transactions, personal information (e.g. home address, birthdate, medical history), etc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Creation, management and storage of digital identities is the key to providing said services, and therefore it is essential that Yassir will rely on its own identity stack and solutions, rather than relying on 3rd party providers.\u00a0Provisioning of on-demand services, payments, banking and financial services - all require accurate and secured representation of people, businesses and organizations, which is done through an IDP that is designed to the specificities of our region and users.Becoming a leading Identity provider will especially enable the expansion and domination of our neo-bank offerings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Central Authentication</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Central authentication is at the heart of digital identity services and it could be part of a future IDP platform.Central authentication allows end-users to access multiple applications while providing their credentials (such as user ID and password) only once.\u00a0It allows Yassir to build, maintain and evolve one central and unified authentication authority and ensure its security, efficiency and functionality, for 1st party clients, and in the future - also to 3rd parties.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Authentication Team\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The authentication solutions need to be built and evolved by a dedicated team that will operate independently from the existing teams, to ensure an agnostic solution that can be abstracted and scaled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Product Manager Role &amp; Responsibilities</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The PM will work alongside the engineering lead to analyze the current state of authentication in the company, including existing authentication systems, components, practices and dependencies.

A\u00b7Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A\u00b7Teamers earn $85+ million since.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em>As part of A\u00b7Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $90-$150+/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, Pepsi, Walmart, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/Insight/Tiger/etc.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say \"no\" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A\u00b7Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too.\u00a0</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $120/hr, you get $120/hr.

Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. \u201cEngineer, Platform\u201d, \u201cSales, Business Development\u201d or \u201cManager, Talent\u201d).

We are looking for people who want to make an impact across the organization, try new ideas, fail fast and celebrate victories while improving the lives of our clients and growing their own careers.</p>\n<p><strong>WHY SCUBA?</strong></p>\n<p>Scuba Analytics is changing the data analytics industry through our platform that allows infinite, sophisticated and layered questions to be asked of all of the customer data. We bring an easy-to-use platform to the entire organization, instead of requiring trained data analysts to produce a limited set of static reports to make data-driven decisions. Our unique approach was originated by Facebook engineers who found that the best commercial tools were not powerful enough to support real-time exploration of billions of daily user actions and interactions. With Scuba Analytics, the entire organization can stop guessing and start knowing how and why customers are acting, interacting and transacting with their products and services, in real time and throughout all time.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT YOU'LL OWN:</strong></p>\n<p>As a Technical Customer Success Manager at Scuba Analytics, you are the primary point of contact for your portfolio of customer accounts.

            "description": "<p>Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on.</p>\n<p>Working with Consensys puts you at the <strong>forefront of an evolving paradigm</strong>, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we\u2019re far from reaching our full potential. You\u2019ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects \u2014 challenging you to stay at the <strong>top of your game</strong>. You\u2019ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the <strong>edge of our ecosystem</strong>. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>About\u00a0</strong><strong>Infura</strong></p>\n<p>Infura is the leading infrastructure platform providing scalable and easy-to-use APIs and cloud solutions for blockchain and decentralized application developers. Infura currently offers APIs for Ethereum, IPFS, and other leading decentralized networks, allowing developers to immediately begin building instead of spending time on architecting and maintaining their own infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Infura provides developers instant access to decentralized and blockchain networks without the need to sync or understand complicated peer to peer infrastructure. Similar to how one might access a cloud service to alleviate the friction of owning proprietary compute and storage, Infura lowers the barrier to entry for engineers to begin building.</p>\n<p>We believe in a more equitable and decentralized future, and we know developers will be at the forefront of that progress. We want to empower developers to spend their time building, creating, and evolving by providing them with the best and easiest solution to their infrastructure needs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>What you\u2019ll do</strong></p>\n<p>Team leads are focussed on delivering excellence in execution. The engineering manager is accountable for delivering projects, prioritizing work for the team, and representing the team\u2019s interests as a point of contact. In people management, the team lead will work with engineering directors to coach and develop the careers of the team members. Holding one on ones, identifying and coaching areas for improvement, and strengthening the team as a whole is important to maintaining a high performing team. The team lead understands the big picture, knows how projects fit into the larger context, and can communicate this to the team.</p>\n<p>The tech stack is cloud native and largely in Golang. It is microservice oriented and uses a mixture of relational and nonrelational databases.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Would be great if you brought this to the role</strong></p>\n<p>You bring empathy and supportive leadership. You understand that \u201cresponsible for\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean doing the task, but delegating the task to the right person on the team. You are product minded and can help represent the engineering perspective when we create solutions. You have a strong background in software engineering and while you may not code everyday now, you have the knowledge it will take to guide the team. You know how software is put together, how to navigate the challenges, and know how to manage trade offs to deliver a project. Basic project management skills are a bonus. While you may not be running scrum ceremonies, knowing how to break up work and deliver a project as a team is an essential skill.</p>\n<p>Experience in the technologies used in our webstack is something that will make you successful in this role. While blockchain (and specifically Ethereum and IPFS) experience will be very helpful in these roles, it is not required.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We\u2019re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment\u2014apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.</p>\n<p><em>Consensys is an equal opportunity employer.

            "description": "<div class=\"h2\">Job Summary</div>\n<p>We're expanding our Design and Product Management Team to include a versatile Product Manager who excels at product growth but is also strong in core/feature work and excited to collaborate on product-market fit expansion concepts. Sports Reference currently serves 20 million (and growing) monthly users through our free, ad-supported Reference sites (Baseball Reference, Basketball Reference, etc.) and Stathead (our SaaS offering that empowers users to dive deeper into our massive Reference databases with powerful search and filtering tools). We also recently acquired Immaculate Grid, the viral baseball trivia game, and have since launched ad-supported grid games for basketball, football, hockey, and soccer.</p>\n<p>Our sites display performance metrics for thousands of athletes but your focus will be on the performance metrics of our products, such as conversion funnels, event data, and churn rate. You'll be focused on how our users are finding, using, and succeeding with our products. With that increased understanding, we will devise new strategies to find even more people who will love our products.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Background</div>\n<p>Sports Reference's capacity to make well-informed product decisions is growing. The current, five-person Product Group includes a wide range of disciplines, such as web development, research methods, design, user experience research, and SEO. We're seeking a Product Manager who can work with all of these disciplines (as well as our Marketing, Data, and Engineering Teams) to help define and execute our product strategy and roadmap.</p>\n<p>You will report to the Director of Design and Product Management. We have many of the ingredients of a high-performing product team in place. Our core purpose and North Star metrics (including their inputs) are well-known across the company. We have a mountain of product ideas recorded as Bet Sheets. Our products are performing well, but we know there is an opportunity to amplify that success.</p>\n<p>Your success in this position will be a combination of driving growth (with a focus on Stathead's growth), enhancing existing products and features to facilitate that growth, using data effectively, ensuring user satisfaction, and collaborating on new ways to expand product-market fit. It's a multifaceted role that demands a blend of strategic thinking, data analysis, collaboration, and user-centric focus.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">To Apply</div>\n<p>Please visit our jobs website at <a href=\"https://sports-reference-llc.breezy.hr/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sports-reference-llc.breezy.hr/</a> and submit your resume and a cover letter for this position. In your cover letter, describe your experience and why you think you would be a great fit for this role. We believe that knowledge of the sports industry (as a fan or follower, not necessarily on a professional level) would put a candidate at a significant advantage, but we would consider an exceptional candidate who does not follow sports closely.</p><p>We will begin the phone interview process the week of February 5, 2024. Applications arriving after this date, will be collected, but will receive consideration at the discretion of the hiring manager based on the progress we have made in filling the position. We have provided a general outline of our interview process here: <a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/job-interview-process.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.sports-reference.com/job-interview-process.html</a></p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Our Purpose and Values</div>\n<p>We democratize data, so our users enjoy, understand, and share the sports they love.</p>\n<p>We value:</p>\n<ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Respect for our users, the athletes we cover, and our team;</li><li style=\"\">Craftsmanship in building tools and products;</li><li style=\"\">Reliable tools and services that meet our users' needs every day; and</li><li style=\"\">Data democratization. We publish many data sets for emerging and underserved sports. For instance, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/15/sports/baseball/baseball-reference-negro-leagues.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York Times covered our recognition of the Negro Leagues as major leagues in the summer of 2021</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>To meet these expectations, we encourage team members to participate in company discussions and share new ideas, features or potential solutions to problems.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Goals and Tasks for Your First Year (In rough order of importance)</div>\n<div class=\"h3\">Must-Reach Goals and Tasks</div>\n<ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Develop a deep understanding of our products and the users who rely on them.</li><li style=\"\">Manage and optimize the Stathead conversion funnel. Ensure campaigns are properly tracked so we can better understand the upgrade path from our free Reference sites to Stathead. By working closely with Marketing and Engineering, you'll optimize these campaigns and develop new ones.</li><li style=\"\">Also lead additional core/feature product work, including creating project detail sheets, documenting feature specifications, and testing throughout the development process.</li><li style=\"\">Work with the Director of Design and Product\u00a0Management\u00a0to define and execute the product strategy and roadmap through feature and growth work as well as product-market fit expansion. We will be guided by our purpose and north star metrics while favoring outcomes over outputs.</li><li style=\"\">Prepare for, lead, and synthesize user interviews related to the efforts you are leading. Additionally, regularly attend interviews related to product discovery that are led by other researchers and PMs.</li><li style=\"\">Be an active member of our Product Group. Regularly participate in Bet Sheet meetings (where we review new product ideas), prioritization exercises, and any other team rituals.</li><li style=\"\">Develop strong working relationships with all other teams at Sports Reference (Engineering, Marketing, and Data).</li></ul>\n<div class=\"h3\">Nice-to-Reach Goals and Tasks</div>\n<ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Be comfortable making small changes in our codebase (such as adding UTM campaigns, tracking events, and text edits).</li><li style=\"\">Identify ways to apply more experimentation in our work so we can quickly learn and adjust.</li><li style=\"\">We describe the guiding philosophy of the visual design and usability of our sites as \u201caggressively functional.\u201d We are in the initial planning stages of our first design refresh in over six years. You will most likely play a supporting role in this effort, but it will impact the products you are working on. Our end goal will be a modernized look and feel across the Reference sites and Stathead, but one that remains classic and focuses heavily on data presentation, page speed, accessibility, and readability.</li></ul>\n<div class=\"h2\">Qualifications and Skills</div>\n<ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Familiarity with product analytics (Google Analytics or similar), such as event and conversion tracking. We are expecting some experience here but not necessarily extensive experience. There is room to grow here, rather than bringing in someone already at an expert level.</li><li style=\"\">Experience working on a software-as-a-service, e-commerce, or subscription product would be considered a plus.</li><li style=\"\">For example, a UX Designer/Researcher, project manager, or scrum master looking to move into product management could be a good fit if that person worked for a company selling a product or service to end users and understands how product analytics can positively influence their work.</li><li style=\"\">Continue your ongoing professional development, which we will support.</li></ul>\n<div class=\"h2\">Salary</div>\n<p>Salary range starting at $93k for U.S. based employees. We are a remote-first company and determine our pay range for this position based on the market rates for Philadelphia, our home base. The salary offered will be based on your experience and skill level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For candidates outside of the United States, we will calculate a local market rate based on pay for comparable positions in that market and comparable benefits packages when possible.</p>\n<p>Annual bonuses are variable and are tied to a percentage of the company's end of year profits and the employee's time worked and salary earned during the year. In the last three years, they have averaged 15% of annual salary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1888050/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"

Path takes a patient-first approach, where treatment is more accessible, personalized, and effective. With Path, it\u2019s easy to find a high-quality therapist or psychiatric clinician who accepts insurance and is actively accepting new patients.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We are deeply committed to providing high-quality care that improves the lives of patients, investing in the providers who deliver that care, and always operating in an ethical and compliant manner.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>What we\u2019re solving</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Over 65 million Americans have a treatable mental health issue \u2014 that\u2019s 1 in 5 people. Today it\u2019s difficult to find a provider, and for those with complicated conditions, it\u2019s nearly impossible to find coordinated care. There\u2019s a good chance someone close to you could have used the help, even if it wasn\u2019t obvious to the people around them.

            "description": "<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Hi \ud83d\udc4b I\u2019m <a href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Colin</u></a>, Director of Engineering, Europe. How do you feel about engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets? If that sounds exciting (even if a bit scary), read on because I\u2019m looking for an engineering manager to help us build a different type of engineering team and culture at Ashby.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">To start, why do we need to be different? Time and again, I have witnessed engineers knowing what needs to be done yet being unable to get things done because of \u201cthe process\u201d or because \u201cmore data is needed.\u201d Some of the most effective projects have been <em>skunkworks </em>projects, where engineers have taken total ownership of a problem and driven it to completion. I want to normalize that at Ashby.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">When we think about how these processes came about, we realize they carry a <em>pessimistic</em> mindset. They box people into smaller roles to minimize the chance of not meeting a certain standard. At Ashby. we\u2019re building an environment that is <em>optimistic </em>about what engineers can own and achieve and embraces the innovative engineers (and frankly, often stays out of their way).</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Doing this requires a broader set of skills in individual engineers. Technical and product management skills blended with customer empathy and business context. Finding and growing people with such a broad set of skills is a challenge, it\u2019s also deeply fulfilling.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">To accomplish this, our engineering leaders need to think deeply about process, culture, and individual performance - not running sprint planning or driving product and technical decisions. You\u2019ll focus on building your team, their skills to thrive with the ownership they\u2019re given, and an environment that empowers them to do their best work consistently, with little distraction.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">This role is heavily focused on growing engineers. For example, many managers view themselves as working to unblock engineers. We view that managers should be coaching engineers on how to unblock themselves.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We\u2019ve already gathered an<a href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>experienced, talented, and collaborative team</u></a> of 25+ engineers. You\u2019ll help me manage the growing team of engineers in Europe.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">In addition to working with engineers you\u2019ll also get to work on projects yourselves. Some examples of work our engineering leaders have done:</p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Provide feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don\u2019t make the final decisions, but you\u2019ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects, and deliver them with little intervention. They still ask for help when needed - the difference is that they\u2019re driving.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Rethink how we (and the industry) do pull request reviews by aligning on goals with the team, sampling a set of PRs to understand how effective they are, and writing a proposal to the team about what we could change to speed up reviews while giving reviewers the time and space to give useful feedback.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Design and improve interview tracks based on candidate and team feedback. We pride ourselves on having thoughtful interviews that simulate actually working with us!</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It\u2019s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Why You Should or Shouldn\u2019t Apply</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Engineering leadership comes in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. I thought I\u2019d outline some things I\u2019m looking for to help you decide if this fits what you\u2019re looking for:</p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>You are technical</em> and can hold in-depth conversations with direct reports from infra to backend to frontend.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>You know what exceptional engineers look like.</em> You\u2019ve thought deeply about what makes them tick, how to recruit them, and how to grow folks into them. I want to see depth here, the industry often regurgitates a vanilla description, but the reality is more nuanced.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>You hold your team to a high standard</em> and don\u2019t shy away from getting into the details and giving feedback, even to the best folks on your team.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>You\u2019re good at thinking about product, business</em>, and maybe even design, but you\u2019re not interested in calling the shots and are more interested in building a team that can make the best decisions without you.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>You think engineering culture and process could use improvement</em>, and you\u2019ve tried or successfully implemented something that sheds the status quo in pursuit of something better.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>You are an excellent and empathetic communicator.</em> Facilitating change at both an individual and organization level requires understanding how to navigate the beliefs, opinions, and past experiences of engineers and figuring out how to both convince them of a new way of doing things while also leaving yourself open to feedback.\u00a0</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You don\u2019t enjoy coding or don\u2019t find time to stay up-to-date on technology.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You want to make all the product decisions instead of empowering your team to make those calls.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You're happy with a team of engineers that are predominantly early-career, mid-career, or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy. With enough guardrails, the team can get things done.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A staff or principal engineer to you is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You\u2019re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently than the status quo. You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h1\">What We\u2019re Building</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Talent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Ashby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I\u2019ll share more once we meet.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Engineering Culture</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our engineering culture is motivated by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Abhik</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Benji</u></a>\u2019s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Collaboration is Natural, Communication is Deliberate</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them <a href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers can focus 36h out of a 40h work week (Abhik wrote about it <a href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>). Even managers can rely on getting consistent time (and support to make, if necessary) to focus and do creative work without the demand of constant meetings.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Increase Leverage, not Team Size</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 5x a day.

Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video on it <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Here\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p>\n<div>\n<div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%;\">\u00a0</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h2\">\u00a0</div>\n<div class=\"h2\">Give Engineers Ownership &amp; Autonomy</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. All of us in technical leadership did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don\u2019t get to practice as engineers, and, as a manager at Ashby, you\u2019ll provide mentorship and feedback to engineers to ensure they are successful when delivering projects.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Put Effort into Diversity\u00a0</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Diverse teams<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>drive innovation and better outcomes</u></a>. As the father of two young girls, I want to see them grow up in a world where all industries are open <em>and welcoming</em> to everyone, regardless of race, gender, or preferences. Helping to build a more diverse team at Ashby is my way of contributing to this change.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Today, 26% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Interview Process</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self.

Our interview process is six interviews in the following order:\u00a0</p>\n<ol style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>Intro Call (30m)</em> - Discuss your application questions, align on the responsibilities of the role, and answer questions about Ashby.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>Past Experience Deep Dive (1h)</em> - Discuss your past experience as an engineering leader.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>Technical Screen (1h)</em> - Add a feature back to Ashby.

They secure over 100 large enterprises, such as the European central bank, Aegon, Essent, Dutch Railways, Malakoff, PostNL, ASR, Damen, and many more. Also, they secure more than 80% of the Business 2 government traffic in their local market.</p>\n<p>Their vision is centered around connecting and protecting people, businesses, and things. They believe in creating an optimal balance between ease-of-use and safety in the user-journey. No matter if it is for a day, a full lifetime, just temporary or occasionally. Who the user is, what the user is allowed to do, enabling the user to opt-in or out defines the relationship and its governance. Identity management is the basis of every online interaction and a true precondition in the implementation of any digital strategy.</p>\n<p>Ask your average CIO (a fun thought exercise, the \u2018average\u2019 CIO) for a list of their digital concerns, and it\u2019ll probably include \u2018protecting our online identity.\u2019 Maybe not as high up as it should be, but identity management is a scalding hot topic. That means the Customer Identity &amp; Access Management (\u2018CIAM\u2019) market is booming. Our client cheerfully challenges the global CIAM giants, David versus Goliath style. Rebellious yet reliable, self-assured but never presumptuous, and always (deeply) human, their all-inclusive team secures 100+ large enterprises, including the European Central Bank, Aegon, Essent, and Damen. Driven by the ambition to connect and protect in equal measure, their solutions enable customers to sign in safely and effortlessly. And to assume full control over their credentials.</p>\n<p><strong>These 5 questions help you to decide if you want us to call you to discover your career opportunities. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. What you will do?</strong></p>\n<p>Develop and deploy cloud solutions that up the identity management ante!</p>\n<p><strong>2. What do you need to succeed?</strong></p>\n<p>You maximize your impact by collaborating with architects, engineers, and product owners. And yes, your input on architectural and technical decisions is always welcome. The opportunity to experiment with advanced tooling and participate in tech communities, where you can bounce ideas off of peers and advance your expertise, makes this role extra attractive. They actively encourage innovation, don\u2019t live inside any box, promote autonomy, and strive for diversity. And no, despite their size and ambitions, red tape is nowhere to be seen; they\u2019d rather develop and support solutions (90% of their time!) than jump through bureaucratic hoops.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Why join this team?</strong></p>\n<p>You can expect a warm onboarding to one of their agile R&amp;D teams. Together with equally tech-savvy colleagues, you will develop, implement, and deploy a variety of CIAM-related cloud solutions. Solutions that receive high marks on availability, performance, resilience, and scalability. While coding from scratch is definitely on the agenda, so are refactoring and continually improving existing solutions. If something can be made even slightly better, they\u2019re all over it.
