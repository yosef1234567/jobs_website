Job Search Web App README

My very first js project.

start point: index.html

Demonstrates a variaty of fundamentals in html-css-JavaScript, including api and async, bootstrap utilities for styling, and localStorage, 
as well as basic programming fundamentals non-specific to js.
The program runs a webpage that shows available jobs in an interactive and user-friendly manner, using the remotive api for up-to-date jobs,
Every job appears in a card including the main details and a scroll unit for more information, the cards also consists of the company logo, (if provided through remotive api),
and the flag of the country associated with this job (if there's).
The page allows to perform filters like category, saved jobs, or free search (free search is not available yet).
Jobs are saved to the local storage, so refreshing the page doesn't affect the saved jobs.

CREDITS: the project uses: bootstrap, restcountries.com, remotive.com
